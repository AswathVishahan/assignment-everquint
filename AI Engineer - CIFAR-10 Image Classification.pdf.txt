CIFAR-10 Image Classification  Objective Build and train deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Apply best practices in data handling, model architecture, training loops, and evaluation.   Part 1 — Core Coding Task  Build and train a neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  Requirements 1. Data Pipeline o Load CIFAR-10 dataset o Apply standard preprocessing (normalization, augmentations, batching) o Demonstrate efficient data loading (tf.data or torch.utils.data.DataLoader) 2. Model Architecture o Implement a small CNN from scratch (not a pre-trained model), including: § Convolutional layers § BatchNorm § Dropout § A final classification head 3. Training o Implement a clear training loop: § Loss computation § Accuracy metrics § Learning rate scheduling o Save checkpoints 4. Evaluation o Plot loss & accuracy curves o Compute test accuracy o Show sample misclassified images 5. Reproducibility o Set random seeds o Provide environment/requirements file  Deliverables • Source code (Python scripts or notebook)

• README explaining: o Project structure o Training setup o Model design decisions o How to run the code  Part 2 — Model Improvement Challenge  After the baseline model is working, implement one of the following improvements:  Option A — Add a Residual Block Create a simplified version of a ResNet block and integrate it into your CNN.  Option B — Add a Custom Callback / Training Utility Example: • TensorBoard (TF) • Custom PyTorch callback or logger • Early stopping • Gradient clipping  Option C — Hyperparameter Tuning Perform tuning on: • Learning rate • Batch size • Optimizer • Dropout rate  Provide results comparing baseline vs improved model.  Optional Extensions • Implement mixed-precision training • Use distributed training (Multi-GPU / TPU / DDP) • Deploy the trained model with FastAPI, Flask, or TensorFlow Serving • Convert model to ONNX and perform inference • Add unit tests for model components
