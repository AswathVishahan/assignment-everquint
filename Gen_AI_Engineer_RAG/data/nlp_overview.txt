Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language.
Early NLP systems were rule-based, relying on handwritten grammar rules.
Statistical NLP emerged in the 1990s, using machine learning to analyze large corpora of text.
Modern NLP is dominated by deep learning, specifically Transformers like BERT and GPT.
Common NLP tasks include:
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of text.
- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names of people, places, and organizations.
- Question Answering: Automatically answering questions based on context.
