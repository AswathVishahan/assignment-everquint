A vector database is a type of database that indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search.
Embeddings are numerical representations of data (like text, images, or audio) that capture semantic meaning.
In an embedding space, similar concepts are located close to each other.
Common vector databases include Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, and Chroma.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings that are similar to each other.
It is widely used in RAG systems to find the most relevant chunks of text for a given query.
Cosine similarity is a common metric used to measure the distance between two vectors.
