Deep learning dates back to the 1940s with the invention of the perceptron by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.
However, it wasn't until the 2000s and 2010s that it became practical due to the availability of large datasets (Big Data) and powerful GPUs.
In 2012, AlexNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge by a significant margin, sparking the modern deep learning boom.
Key figures in the field include Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, often referred to as the "Godfathers of AI".
Deep learning models are composed of multiple layers of neurons that learn hierarchical representations of data.
